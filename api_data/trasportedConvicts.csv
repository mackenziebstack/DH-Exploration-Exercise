PRISONER BARBOR's DEFENCE. I rely on your mercy: I look on it I am in the hands of very wicked people. It was a very wet night, I went into Mr. Woodley's about ten o'clock, and stopped half an hour; the prisoner was much in liquor, he asked me to drink, and where I lived; I told him he might go up stairs, an acquaintance lived there, the bed was down and made; he said, God bless me, I could not have thought so good a bed had been in this distressed place; says he, what shall I give you to lay with you all night; I says, Sir, you could not go to offer any body less than a crown; he said, I think half-a-crown is enough; I said make me a present of that; he said, undress yourself first; I said no, but there is no harm done, go down stairs again. There was a shelf behind the door, there were a dozen and an half of Queen's ware plates, two large dishes, and a bowl; he staggered against the door, and threw down the shelf, and broke the things; a little girl in the next room told Brady and Denton they were broke: he refused to pay for them.

The prisoner Woodley called three witnesses who gave him a good character; and one of them said he saw him lend some money on a watch, but could not tell what watch. To Price. Did you see what was thrown down? - I heard them fall, and I turned round, they were a yard and an half from me; they were behind me, I never saw them till they fell, it seemed to be a board a yard long, and they seemed to be broke before, they seemed like white plates; there might be eight or nine.

I understand you was going to be married to Mr. Edmonds ? - Yes, I was, and he desired me to say no other but what I was his wife, on account of his sister. Had he any money then? - none but what from me. he return? - Between ten was much in liquor, and in my lap; and he went to a public-house and ordered some beer, and there I understand he threw some money about, so he did when he came in again, and I seven guineas, five gold, the piece of larger than a guinea, I took it to be a thirty-six shillings piece; in the meeting he told me had received 8 l. of his own money, and that the half-crowns and that piece of gold was not his property. On Saturday his sister was to come; he went and bought me a new hat, and Mrs. Goodall and he went somewhere, but where I do not know. Had you heard of the old woman being at Tottenham before the robbery? - No, Sir, I had not. When were the cloaths brought back? - Either on Friday or Saturday, I am sure they were Edmonds's cloaths, they were lent to Mrs. Simpson, to dress herself in, and were brought back after the robbery. What is become of Simpson and his wife? - I do not know. Was the old woman present when the cloaths were returned? - Yes. Did she know who had them? - Yes, she was in the house when Mrs. Simpson was dressed in them, and when they were returned. PRISONER's Counsel.

Who shew'd it you then? - I do not know; a gentleman sent for me and shewed it me then, he asked me if I could swear that was the same piece, and I said I could not; (looks at the medal) I do not think it is any thing like what I saw; ( the prosecutrix looked at it and said she saw nothing like that.)
